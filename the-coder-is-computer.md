# Hey there..
## Linux Tutorial
ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

**Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are
familiar with such as Windows and OSX.
This tutorial won't focus on these as I reckon you can probably figure that part out by yourself.
This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash**


# Comparison of “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE:

### An IDE has complementing features meant to help web developers accomplish tasks with higher productivity.
For example, when using an IDE, programmers can access databases or automatically write code to create a graphical user interface (GUI).
Furthermore, some IDEs provide suggested ways to complete strings of code. That 
means you don’t have to type the entire line and save time.

### In contrast, a text editor only does as its name describes and allows writing and making changes to the text.
Once a programmer creates code in a text editor,
they can then input the content into command-line win.

software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text.

# The Shell, Bash

***Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will 
behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.
There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash 
which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.
If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called echo to display
a system variable stating your current 
shell.echo is a command which is used to display messages***
