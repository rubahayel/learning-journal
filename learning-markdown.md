#  Hi my name is ruba and i'll talking about markdown.

## Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic,

Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or*.



if you want to embed images, this is how you do it:
